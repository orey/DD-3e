## EPIC FEATS

### 



### ACQUIRING EPIC FEATS

Characters gain epic feats in the following ways:

At 21st level, and every three levels thereafter, the character may select an epic feat in place of a nonepic feat.

Each character class gains bonus epic feats according to the class description. These feats must be selected from the list of bonus epic feats for that class.





### PREREQUISITES

Most epic feats have prerequisites. A character must have the listed ability score, feat, skill, class feature, or base attack modifier in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain an epic feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite, just as with regular feats. A prerequisite expressed as a numerical value is a minimum; any value higher than the one given also meets the prerequisite. A character can’t use an epic feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.





### TYPES OF EPIC FEATS

Most epic feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others may be item creation feats or metamagic feats, which follow all the normal rules for such feats, except as specified in the feat’s description. In addition, some feats are defined as divine feats or as wild feats. Such feats are described below.

### 



### DIVINE FEATS

The feats in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all have as a prerequisite the ability to turn (or, in most cases, rebuke) undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level or higher, and any prestige class that has that ability. (An ability to turn other creatures does not qualify a character to select one of these feats.) Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead. Each use of a divine feat costs the character one turn/rebuke attempt from his or her number of attempts each day. If a character doesn’t have any turn/rebuke attempts left, he or she can’t use the feat. Since turning or rebuking is a standard action, activating any of these feats is also a standard action.

### 



### WILD FEATS

The feats in this category share the characteristic of relating to the ability to usewild shapeas a druid. These feats require the character to have the ability to usewild shapebefore acquiring the feat.

### 



### EPIC PSIONIC FEATS

Psionic characters can acquire epic “psionically flavored” feats. Some feats require so much translation that converted feats are provided. Whenever a feat concerns conferring or altering a spell in some fashion, some translation must be done to use it with psionics. Sometimes this translation is as straightforward as changing a few names. Translating epic metamagic feats to epic metapsionic feats requires that Spellcraft prerequisites be replaced with Psicraft. It also requires a little math—instead of casting a spell at a higher level, a psionic character pays more power points. For every spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level the metamagic feat requires, the metapsionic feat requires a character to pay a power point cost equal to its standard cost +2. Likewise, when a feat allows a spellcaster to “pay” one less level to use a metamagic feat, the psionic version allows a character to pay 2 power points less for a given metapsionic feat.



FEATS

The Improved Spell Capacity feat allows characters to gain spell slots above 9th level (which can be used to hold lower-level spells or spells whose level has been increased beyond 9th by the use of metamagic feats).

A character with a very high score in the ability associated with his or her spellcasting (Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers; or Charisma for bards and sorcerers) may receive bonus spells of those levels, as shown on Table: Expanded Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, but only if they already have at least one spell slot of that level (such as from the Improved Spell Capacity feat). A character without any spell slots of a level can’t receive any bonus spells of that level, even if the appropriate ability score is high enough to award them.

Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression continues infinitely in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level, expand the table to follow the same patterns as shown.

These undead are automatically under the character’s command, though his or her normal limit of commanded undead still applies. If the corpses are relatively fresh, the animated undead are zombies.
