### DARKMANTLE



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table01.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table01.png)

The darkmantle hangs from a ceiling by a muscular “foot” at the top of its body. It can look like a stalactite, by holding its tentacles stiffly under itself, or like a lump of rock, spreading its tentacles so the membrane between them covers its body. Its shell and skin usually resemble limestone, but a darkmantle can change its color to match almost any type of stony background.

A darkmantle is about 4 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the top of its head. It weighs about 30 pounds.

COMBAT

A darkmantle attacks by dropping onto its prey and wrapping its tentacles around the opponent’s head. Once attached, it squeezes and tries to suffocate the foe. A darkmantle that misses its initial attack often flies up and tries to drop on the opponent again.

**Darkness (Su):**Once per day a darkmantle can cause darkness as thedarknessspell (caster level 5th). It most often uses this ability just before attacking.

**Improved Grab (Ex):**To use this ability, a darkmantle must hit a Large or smaller creature with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it attaches to the opponent’s head and can constrict.

**Constrict (Ex):**A darkmantle deals 1d4+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.

**Blindsight (Ex):**A darkmantle can “see” by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain objects and creatures within 90 feet. Asilencespell negates this ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle.

**Skills:**A darkmantle has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated. The creature’s variable coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.





DELVER



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table02.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table02.png)

A delver is about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. It weighs about 6,000 pounds.

Delvers speak Terran and Undercommon.

COMBAT

A delver prefers to fight from its tunnel, which it uses to protect its flanks while lashing out with its flippers.

A delver expecting trouble may honeycomb an area with tunnels, leaving most closed with layers of stone 1 or 2 inches thick.

The delver can quickly dissolve the stone cover and pop up to attack unexpectedly.

**Corrosive Slime (Ex):**A delver produces a mucuslike slime that contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly effective against stone. A delver’s mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, a delver’s slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points of damage. A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An opponent’s armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons takes damage from its slime each time an attack hits unless the creature succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. These save DCs are Constitution-based.

**Stone Shape (Ex):**A delver can alter its slime to temporarily soften stone instead of dissolving it. Once every 10 minutes, a delver can soften and shape up to 25 cubic feet of stone, as astone shapespell (caster level 15th).





DEMON

Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it—even other demons.

Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

—Immunity to electricity and poison.

—Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10.

—Summon(Sp): Many demons share the ability to summon others of their kind (the success chance and type of demon summoned are noted in each monster description). Demons are often reluctant to use this power until in obvious peril or extreme circumstances.

—Telepathy.

Except where otherwise noted, demons speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.





BABAU



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table03.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table03.png)

A babau is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 140 pounds.

Combat

Babaus are sneaky and sly. They attack the most powerful foe first, hoping to eliminate the true threats quickly and then toy with the rest. When ambushing their opponents, they make excellent use of the combination of multiple attacks and sneak attacks.

A babau’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Sneak Attack (Ex):**A babau can make a sneak attack like a rogue, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage whenever a foe is denied his or her Dexterity bonus, or when the babau is flanking.

**Spell-Like Abilities:**At will—darkness, dispel magic, see invisibility,greater teleport(self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 7th.

**Protective Slime (Su):**A slimy red jelly coats the babau’s skin. Any weapon that touches it takes 1d8 points of acid damage from the corrosive goo, and the weapon’s hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic weapon may attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid taking this damage. A creature who strikes the babau with an unarmed attack, unarmed strike, touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage as well but can negate the damage with a DC 18 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

**Summon Demon****(Sp):**Once per day a babau can attempt to summon 1 babau with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

**Skills:**Babaus have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Search checks.





BALOR



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table04.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table04.png)

A balor stands about 12 feet tall. Its skin is usually dark red. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.

**Combat**

Balors love to join battle armed with their swords and whips. If they face stiff resistance, they may teleport away to loose a few spell-like effects at the foe.

A balor’s+1 flaming whipis a long, flexible weapon with many tails tipped with hooks, spikes, and balls. The weapon deals bludgeoning and slashing damage, in addition to fire damage.

A balor’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Death Throes (Ex):**When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding flash of light that deals 100 points of damage to anything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 30 half ). This explosion automatically destroys any weapons the balor is holding. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Entangle (Ex):**A balor’s+1 flaming whipentangles foes much like an attack with a net. The whip has 20 hit points. The whip needs no folding. If it hits, the target and the balor immediately make opposed Strength checks; if the balor wins, it drags the target against its flaming body (see below). The target remains anchored against the balor’s body until it escapes the whip.

**Spell-Like Abilities:**At will—blasphemy(DC 25),dominate monster(DC 27),greater dispel magic, greater teleport(self plus 50 pounds of objects only),insanity(DC 25),power word stun, telekinesis(DC 23),unholy aura(DC 26); 1/day—fire storm(DC 26),implosion(DC 27). Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Vorpal Sword (Su):**Every balor carries a+1 vorpal longswordthat looks like a flame or a bolt of lightning.

**Summon Demon****(Sp):**Once per day a balor can automatically summon 4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrous, or one nalfeshnee, glabrezu, marilith, or balor. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

**Flaming Body (Su):**The body of a balor is wreathed in flame.

Anyone grappling a balor takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round.

**True Seeing (Su):**Balors have a continuous true seeing ability, as the spell (caster level 20th).

**Skills:**Balors have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

**Tactics Round-by-Round**

The balor is most effective as a ranged combatant, using its spell-like abilities to attack from a distance.

Prior to combat: Unholy aura.

Round 1: Fire stormorimplosionand quickenedtelekinesis,or summon additional demons. If the balor does not deem itself seriously threatened, it conserves abilities usable only once per day and usesblasphemyinstead.

Round 2: Insanityorpower word stun.

Round 3:Full melee attack with weapons, including entangle with whip.

Round 4: Teleportor fly away with entangled foe to reestablish range; repeat round 1 and continue.

BEBILITH



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table05.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table05.png)

Bebiliths are enormous, predatory, arachnid demons that hunt other demons. A bebilith has a body the size of a plow horse, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs more than two tons.

Bebiliths understand but do not speak Abyssal. Their telepathy allows them to communicate silently with one another.

COMBAT

A bebilith attacks any creature it sees. It usually picks one target and concentrates its attacks on that opponent, using its webs to isolate the target from its comrades. Should the bebilith become overwhelmed by tougher opponents, it often attempts to bite one or more of its victims and retreats, allowing its poison to do its work.

A bebilith’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Poison (Ex):**Injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage 2d6 Con. Bebilith venom is highly perishable, losing its potency and becoming inert, foul-smelling goo almost as soon as it comes into contact with air. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Rend Armor (Ex):**If a bebilith hits with both claw attacks, it pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the opponent’s armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed. Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check.

**Web (Ex):**A bebilith can throw a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 30 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet. This attack is effective against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 24 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 24 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based. The web has 14 hit points and hardness 0. There is a 75% chance that the webbing will not burn if any sort of fire is applied to it (check each round).

**Plane Shift (Su):**This ability affects only the bebilith. It is otherwise similar to the spell (caster level 12th).

**Skills:**A bebilith has mottled coloration that gives it a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks.





DRETCH



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table06.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table06.png)

A dretch is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.

Dretches cannot speak but can communicate telepathically.

Combat

Dretches are slow, stupid, and not very effective combatants. In one-on-one combat, they rely on their damage reduction to keep them alive. In groups, they depend on sheer numbers to overcome foes and immediately summon other dretches to improve the odds in battle. They flee at the first sign of adversity unless more powerful demons are present to intimidate them into fighting. Dretches’ fear of their greater kin is stronger then even their fear of death.

A dretch’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Spell-Like Abilities:**1/day—scare(DC 12),stinking cloud(DC 13). Caster level 2nd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Summon Demon****(Sp):**Once per day a dretch can attempt to summon another dretch with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.

**Telepathy (Su):**Dretches can communicate telepathically with creatures within 100 feet that speak Abyssal.





GLABREZU



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table07.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table07.png)

Like succubi, glabrezu tempt victims into ruin, but they lure their prey with power or wealth rather than passion.

Glabrezu have penetrating violet eyes, and their skin color ranges from deep russet to pitch black. A glabrezu stands about 15 feet tall and weighs about 5,500 pounds.

Combat

Glabrezu prefer subterfuge to combat. However, if their attempts to entice or deceive fail, these enormous demons attack with a vengeance. They follow aconfusionattack with melee attacks, hoping to finish off wounded foes withchaos hammerorunholy blight.

A glabrezu’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Improved Grab (Ex):**To use this ability, a glabrezu must hit a Medium or smaller opponent with a pincer attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

**Spell-Like Abilities:**At will—chaos hammer(DC 19),confusion(DC 19),dispel magic, mirror image, reverse gravity(DC 22),greater teleport(self plus 50 pounds of objects only),unholy blight(DC 19); 1/day—power word stun. Caster level 14th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Once per month, a glabrezu can fulfill awishfor a mortal humanoid. The demon can use this ability to offer a mortal whatever he or she desires—but unless thewishis used to create pain and suffering in the world, the glabrezu demands either terrible evil acts or great sacrifice as compensation.

**Summon Demon****(Sp):**Once per day a glabrezu can attempt to summon 4d10 dretches or 1d2 vrocks with a 50% chance of success, or another glabrezu with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

**True Seeing (Su):**Glabrezu continuously use true seeing as the spell (caster level 14th).

**Skills:**Glabrezu have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.





HEZROU



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table08.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table08.png)

A hezrou can walk both upright and on all fours, but it always fights standing up

A hezrou is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 750 pounds.

Combat

Hezrous enjoy melee combat even more than vrocks do. They eagerly press an attack deep into the heart of enemy forces, so their stench can take effect as quickly as possible. They enter most battles by usingblasphemy,and follow it with an occasionalchaos hammerorunholy blight,depending on the alignment of their opponents.

A hezrou’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Improved Grab (Ex):**To use this ability, a hezrou must hit with both claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

**Spell-Like Abilities:**At will—chaos hammer(DC 18),greater teleport(self plus 50 pounds of objects only),unholy blight(DC 18); 3/day—blasphemy(DC 21),gaseous form.Caster level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Stench (Ex):**A hezrou’s skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same hezrou’s stench for 24 hours. Adelay poisonorneutralize poisonspell removes either condition from one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Summon Demon****(Sp):**Once per day a hezrou can attempt to summon 4d10 dretches or another hezrou with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

**Skills:**Hezrous have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.





MARILITH



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table09.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table09.png)

A marilith usually holds a longsword in each of its six hands and wears many bangles and jewels.

A marilith stands about 9 feet tall and measures about 20 feet from head to tip of tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.

Combat

Though mariliths thrive on grand strategy and army-level tactics, they love physical combat and never pass up an opportunity to fight. Each of a marilith’s six arms can wield a weapon, and the creature gets an additional three weapon attacks with its primary arm. Mariliths seldom rush headlong into battle, however, preferring to hang back and size up the situation first. They always seek to gain the best possible advantage from the local terrain, obstacles, and any vulnerability or weakness in their opponents.

A marilith’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Constrict (Ex):**A marilith deals 4d6+13 points of damage with a successful grapple check. The constricted creature must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or lose consciousness for as long as it remains in the coils and for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Strength-based.

**Improved Grab (Ex):**To use this ability, a marilith must hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it succeeds on the grapple check, it can constrict.

**True Seeing (Su):**Mariliths continuously use this ability, as the spell (caster level 16th).

**Skills:**Mariliths have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

**Feats:**In combination with its natural abilities, a marilith’s Multiweapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with all its arms at no penalty.





NALFESHNEE



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table10.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table10.png)

A nalfeshnee can fly despite its small wings.

A nalfeshnee is more than 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.

Combat

When fulfilling their duties in the underworld, nalfeshnees usually disdain combat as being beneath them. Given the opportunity, they succumb to blood lust and do battle. They disable opponents with their smite ability and slaughter them while they can’t fight back.

A nalfeshnee’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Smite (Su):**Three times per day a nalfeshnee can create a nimbus of unholy light. When the demon triggers the ability, rainbow-colored beams play around its body. One round later they burst in a 60-foot radius. Any creature within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of its worst fears hound it. The creature receives its full Dexterity and shield bonuses to AC if attacked but can take no actions. Other demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**True Seeing (Su):**Nalfeshnees continuously use true seeing, as the spell (caster level 14th).

**Skills:**Nalfeshnees have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.





QUASIT



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table11.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table11.png)

In its natural form, a quasit stands about 1-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 8 pounds.

Quasits speak Common and Abyssal.

Combat

Although quasits thirst for victory and power as other demons do, they are cowards at heart. They typically attack from ambush, using their alternate form ability andinvisibilityto get within reach, then try to scuttle away. When retreating, they use theircause fearability to deter pursuit.

A quasit’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Poison (Ex):**Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 2d4 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Once per week a quasit can usecommuneto ask six questions. The ability otherwise works as the spell (caster level 12th).

**Alternate Form (Su):**A quasit can assume other forms at will as a standard action. This ability functions as apolymorphspell cast on itself (caster level 12th), except that a quasit does not regain hit points for changing form, and any individual quasit can assume only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include bat, monstrous centipede, toad, and wolf. A quasit in alternate form loses its poison attack.





RETRIEVER



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table12.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table12.png)

A retriever specializes in recovering lost or desired objects, runaway slaves, and enemies and bringing them back to its master. A retriever has a body the size of an ox, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs about 6,500 pounds.

Combat

Retrievers attack with four claws, but their eye rays are far more deadly.

**Eye Rays (Su):**A retriever’s eyes can produce four different magical rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray as a free action. A particular ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. A retriever can fire an eye ray in the same round that it makes physical attacks. The save DC for all rays is 18. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

The four eye effects are:

Fire:Deals 12d6 points of fire damage to the target (Reflex half ).

Cold:Deals 12d6 points of cold damage to the target (Reflex half ).

Electricity:Deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to the target (Reflex half ).

Petrification:The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or turn to stone permanently.

**Improved Grab (Ex):**To use this ability, a retriever must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and grips the opponent fast in its mouth. This is the method by which it usually “retrieves” things.





SUCCUBUS



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table13.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table13.png)

A succubus is 6 feet tall in its natural form and weighs about 125 pounds.

Combat

Succubi are not warriors. They flee combat whenever they can. If forced to fight, they can attack with their claws, but they prefer to turn foes against one another. Succubi use theirpolymorphability to assume humanoid guise, and can maintain this deception indefinitely. Their preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is to feign friendship and create an opportunity to be alone with one of them, whereupon the succubus applies her life-draining kiss. Succubi are not above taking on the role of a damsel in distress when encountered within a dungeon.

A succubus’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Energy Drain (Su):**A succubus drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. If the target is not willing to be kissed, the succubus must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. The succubus’s kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of asuggestionspell, asking the victim to accept another kiss from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect of thesuggestion. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Skills:**Succubi have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

*While using herpolymorphability, a succubus gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks.





VROCK



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table14.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table14.png)

A vrock is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.

Combat

Vrocks are vicious fighters who like to fly down into the enemy and cause as much damage as possible. They prance about in battle, taking briefly to the air and bringing their clawed feet into play. Despite their advantage in mobility, the vrocks’ deep love of battle frequently leads them into melee combats against heavy odds.

A vrock’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Dance of Ruin (Su):**To use this ability, a group of at least three vrocks must join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting.

At the end of 3 rounds of dancing, a wave of crackling energy flashes outward in a 100-foot radius. All creatures except for demons within the radius take 20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 18 half ). Stunning, paralyzing, or slaying one of the vrocks stops the dance. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:**At will—mirror image, telekinesis(DC 18),greater teleport(self plus 50 pounds of objects only); 1/day—heroism.Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Spores (Ex):**A vrock can release masses of spores from its body once every 3 rounds as a free action. The spores automatically deal 1d8 points of damage to all creatures adjacent to the vrock. They then penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d4 points of damage each round for 10 rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. (The vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days.) Adelay poisonspell stops the spores’ growth for its duration.Bless, neutralize poison,orremove diseasekills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.

**Stunning Screech (Su):**Once per hour a vrock can emit a piercing screech. All creatures except for demons within a 30-foot radius must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Summon Demon****(Sp):**Once per day a vrock can attempt to summon 2d10 dretches or another vrock with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

**Skills:**Vrocks have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.





DERRO



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table15.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table15.png)

Derro are afflicted by a form of racial madness, which most often manifests as delusions of grandeur coupled with an overpowering urge to inflict torment on other creatures. Derro are capable of holding their murderous impulses in check for short periods of time in order to cooperate with creatures of other races, but such arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of his mind.

COMBAT

Derro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike savagely from hiding. They delight in taking captives who can be tortured to death later, and favor traps and poisons that disable without killing.

**Madness (Ex):**Derro use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and have immunity toconfusionandinsanityeffects. A derro cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of amiracleorwishspell.

DESTRACHAN



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table16.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table16.png)

The dungeon-dwelling destrachan looks like some bizarre, nonintelligent beast, but it’s an incredibly evil and crafty sadist. A destrachan has a pair of complex, three-part ears that it can adjust to be more or less sensitive to various sounds. It is blind, yet hunts with a sense of hearing more precise than most creatures’ sight.

From its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harmonics, producing sonic energy so powerful it can shatter a stone wall. So skilled is a destrachan at controlling the sounds it emits that it can choose what type of material to affect with its attack.

A destrachan is about 10 feet long from its mouth to the tip of the tail and weighs about 4,000 pounds.

A destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If a destrachan must communicate, it does so through action.

COMBAT

A destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes weakened by its sonic attacks. It often enters battle with surprise if possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and then changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh.

**Destructive Harmonics (Su):**A destrachan can blast sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can also use this attack to affect any creatures or objects within a 30-foot radius.

Flesh:Disrupting tissue and rending bone, this attack deals 4d6 points of damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).

Nerves:A destrachan can focus its harmonics to knock out foes rather than slay them. This attack deals 6d6 points of nonlethal damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).

Material:When using this form of harmonics, a destrachan chooses wood, stone, metal, or glass. All objects made of that material within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or shatter. Objects (or portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit points are potentially affected by this attack.

**Blindsight (Ex):**A destrachan can use hearing to ascertain all foes within 100 feet as a sighted creature would.

**Immunities:**Destrachans have immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.

**Protection from Sonics (Ex):**While they can be affected by loud noises and sonic spells (such asghost soundorsilence), destrachans are less vulnerable to sonic attacks (+4 circumstance bonus on all saves) because they can protect their ears. A destrachan whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, and all targets are treated as having total concealment.

**Skills:**A destrachan has a +10 racial bonus on Listen checks.





DEVIL

Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.

Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal.

DEVOURER



























































































![36 MonstersD-De-Table28.png](36 MonstersD-De-Table28.png)

Devourers lurk on the Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane, stalking both natives and travelers with equal sadistic glee.

A devourer is about 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.

Devourers speak Common.

COMBAT

Even if it had no special abilities, a devourer would be a terrible opponent, for its bony claws can flay enemies alive.

**Energy Drain (Su):**Living creatures hit by a devourer’s claw attack orspectral handability gain one negative level. The DC is 19 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Trap Essence (Su)**: The devourer is named for its ability to consume an enemy’s life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee attacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. The he save DC is Charisma-based. A slain creature’s essence is trapped within the devourer’s ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that victim’s features. The trapped essence cannot be raised or resurrected, but alimited wish, miracle,orwishspell frees it, as does destroying the devourer. A devourer can hold only one essence at a time.

The trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of the trapped creature. As this energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it evaporates completely. The trapped essence gains one negative level for every five times the devourer uses one of its spell-like abilities. When the essence’s number of negative levels equals the creature’s total Hit Dice or level, the essence is destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose that level permanently.

**Spell-Like Abilities**: At the start of any encounter, the trapped essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels (enough fuel for thirty to seventy-five uses). Once per round, a devourer can use one of the following abilities:confusion(DC 17),control undead(DC 20),ghoul touch(DC 15),lesser planar ally, ray of enfeeblement(DC 14),spectral hand, suggestion(DC 16),true seeing. Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Spell Deflection (Su):**The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the imprisoned essence instead:banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnosis, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul,or any form of charm or compulsion. In many cases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its spell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.
